# ionic-sqlite-prepolulated
Prepopulated is an Ionic 3 application that reads a list of words from a SQLITE database prepopulated and show them in a list.

Goals: 

* Create an Ionic app.
* Read from a database already populated. I could have another application to fill up the data and then use it from the Ionic App. No need of creating tables or insert data from Ionic.
